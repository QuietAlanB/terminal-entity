As you are already aware, you've been given access to site KILO-CHARLIE-7's systems.
You will unlock more systems with higher access tiers.
This is a basic manual to help you get started.

[1] Scanning and fixing failures
Type 'scan' to scan for any failures.
If a failure/failures are found, the failure(s) will be shown alongside the failure code.
Type 'fix <failure code>' with a correct failure code to begin fixing the failure.
Every failure will require you to do some task, with tasks varying based on the failure.
More serious failures will be harder to fix. Some failures however should take priority over others.
Keep in mind that some failures may directly affect some of your systems.

[2] EXP and power management
You start off with maximum power, and a max power value of 100. 
Your power regenerates fairly slowly, so make sure to balance it properly.
Fixing tasks costs power, with the amount of power scaling based on how serious the task is.
Power will still get consumed even if you fail the task.
You gain EXP for completing tasks, and after enough EXP your access tier will increase.
A higher access tier will make you regenerate power quicker and also grants you access to new systems.
You can check all of these stats with the 'check' command.

[3] Basic utility commands
The 'mail' command allows you to manage your mail
Typing 'delete <mail number>' in the mail interface will delete the mail
Typing 'open <mail number>' or '<mail number>' in the mail interface will view the mail
The 'request <file>' command requests a file from the server and shows it's contents
You wont be able to access most of the files from the servers, but you will be granted access to the files that you need.

This will be all you need up until access tier 2.
Make sure to frequently check your mail for any new information.
