KILO-CHARLIE-7 SITE NETWORK MANUAL
       WRITTEN BY DR. GRAVES
----------------------------------
Kilo-Charlie-7's site network is fairly straightforward:
There are a total of 1024 different ports that connections can come in through.
Every port has an "internal connection" and an "external connection" (normally referred to as just the "connection").
The internal connection is a connection inside of the site, such as a server or computer.
The external connection is a connection outside of the site, normally in a server or computer fairly far away.
This manual outlines how to use the KC7 Management Terminal to manage the site's network.

Ensure that you have entered the network interface by typing 'network'. The input arrow should show 'Network >>'
You can exit the network interface by typing 'exit'.

[1] VIEWING PORTS
The 'port' command is used for managing practically the entire network, however the arguments of this command
will change based on what you'd like to do.
To view a port, simply type 'port <port number>'. 
This will display if the port is open/closed, the port state, and the connections of the port.

[1.1] VIEWING MULTIPLE PORTS
The 'port list' command argument can be used to view many ports at once. 
Typing 'port list' or 'port list open' will list all open ports.
Typing 'port list closed' will list all closed ports, though this isn't useful.
Typing 'port list <state>' will list all ports with that state

[1.2] PORT STATES
Ports have 4 distinct states they can be in: LISTENING, IDLE, CONNECTED, NOT_BOUND
IDLE means that the port has an internal and external connection but no data is being sent through the port
LISTENING means that the port has an internal connection but no external connection
CONNECTED means that the port has data being sent through it
NOT_BOUND means that the port has no internal connection

[2] MANAGING PORTS
Typing 'port <open/close/disconnect> <port number>' will either open, close or disconnect a port depending on the 1st
argument.
Opening a port allows connections through the port.
Closing a port will block all connections through the port.
Disconnecting a port will kick the connection off the port, but keep the port open. (Internal connection will still be connected to the port)

[3] MONITORING PORTS
Typing 'port monitor <port number>' will start monitoring a port.
This will send you the data being sent through the port, as well as what connection the data is being sent to.
Pressing ENTER while monitoring will stop monitoring that port.

[4] SCANNING PORTS
Not implemented.
