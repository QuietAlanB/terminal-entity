Dr. Dan
Access Tier 3

Hello once again. I must congratulate you for your work, as you are much more successful than we ever thought
you could be. Thank you for keeping the site maintained and under control.
You have reached access tier 3, and have now unlocked access to managing the site's network system.
You can access the network interface by simply typing the 'network' command.
Many of the commands do need a decent amount of explanation, which will all be located in the 'network_help.txt' file.
Please request the file as soon as you can, and read carefully.
Now that you've been given control of the site network, you will have to take charge in preventing cyberattacks.
How to do this as well as a lot of other information is in the 'network_help.txt" file.

Kind regards,
Dr. Dan
