Dr. Dan
Access Tier 2

Hello again. Monitors show you've reached access tier 2.
You now have access to the construction system, accessible through 'upgrade' or 'construction'.
You are able to upgrade certain systems with the cost of your power.
Upgrading a system will cost a decent chunk of power, and will normally disable/suspend the system being upgraded.
You can start by upgrading your scanner, allowing you to scan for failures more efficiently.

You will recieve another mail at access tier 3.

Kind regards,
Dr. Dan
