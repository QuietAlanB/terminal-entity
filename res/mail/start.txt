Initialization

Good morning.
As discussed earlier, you've been successfully connected to KILO-CHARLIE-7's power supply which includes access to most on-site systems. 
You've also been connected to the site's network. You will unlock access to more on-site systems with completed tasks.
Ensure that the facility is always operational.

Please input 'request help.txt' to get started.

Thank you,
Dr. Dan
